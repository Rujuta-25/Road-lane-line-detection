# Road Lane Detection using AI

## AIM:
To detect road lane lines using AI in Python.

## ABSTRACT:
Accidents on roads are increasing due to driver inattention. One way to enhance road safety is through Lane Detection Systems, which identify lane boundaries and alert drivers if they deviate from their lane. This project implements a lane detection system using computer vision techniques to process video frames, recognize lane markings, and improve traffic safety. Various challenges such as lighting conditions and road quality are considered in designing the system.

## INTRODUCTION:
Urban traffic safety is a critical issue, with lane discipline being an essential factor in preventing accidents. Computer vision, a branch of artificial intelligence, enables vehicles to analyze and understand their surroundings. The proposed lane detection system aims to accurately identify lane boundaries from video input and enhance road safety by warning drivers about unintended lane departures. The system's application extends to tracking driver behavior and assisting in transportation monitoring.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project involves using a camera mounted on the front of a vehicle to capture road images and process them for lane detection. The system converts video frames into sub-images, extracts relevant features, and detects lane markings using feature-based or model-based techniques. The algorithm helps reduce accidents by warning drivers about unintended lane shifts.
