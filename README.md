# AI-Powered Road Lane Detection

## Objective:
Develop an AI-based system to detect road lane lines in Python, enhancing driver safety and reducing accidents.

## Summary:
With the rising number of road accidents due to driver distraction, a Lane Detection System can serve as a preventive measure. This system identifies lane boundaries in real time and warns drivers when they deviate. The project employs computer vision techniques to analyze video frames, detect lane markings, and improve overall road safety. Consideration is given to various challenges like lighting conditions and road quality.

## Introduction:
Ensuring road safety is critical in urban environments, where traffic congestion and violations contribute to accidents. Lane discipline is a fundamental requirement for safe driving. By leveraging computer vision, an AI system can analyze its surroundings to detect lane markings efficiently. This project aims to build a lane detection mechanism that accurately identifies lane boundaries using video input. The system also has potential applications in driver monitoring and traffic management.

## Project Overview:
A forward-facing camera captures road footage, which is processed to identify lane markings. The system extracts image features and applies feature-based or model-based techniques to detect lanes. The AI-driven algorithm minimizes accident risks by providing timely lane departure warnings to drivers.
